Usage: solitaire-player.bat [--show-prompts] <Game> [Goal] [args for goal] [-f filename]

[--show-prompts] is optional and will prompt you to verify cards or confirm
actions. If you don't use this, it'll basically run unattended.
<Game> is required, and can be either Pyramid, TriPeaks, or FreeCell.
[Goal] can either be Board, Score, or Card. The default is Board.
For FreeCell, only Board works, Score and Card challenges aren't implemented yet.
[args for goal] depends, see below for details.
[-f filename] is to pass in a deck of cards and print out a solution instead of
trying to play the game.  See below for examples.  If you don't use this, the
program will assume Microsoft Solitaire Collection is running and will try to
interact with it.

Card Ranks are A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 T J Q K (always upper case).
Card Suits are c d h s (always lower case).

For Pyramid Solitaire:
1. Pyramid
   - Solve board challenges, clearing all cards from the board.
2. Pyramid Board
   - The same as just Pyramid (solving board challenges).
3. Pyramid Score
   - Find the way to get the maximum possible score.
4. Pyramid Score <Goal Score> <Current Score>
   - "Pyramid Score 2400 1500" means you currently have 1500 points and the
     goal is to get 2400 points.
   - Find the way to reach the goal score given the current score, or if
     impossible, find the way to get the maximum possible score.
5. Pyramid Card <Goal number of cards> <Card Rank> <number currently cleared>
   - "Pyramid Card 12 A 9" means the goal is to remove 12 Aces, and you have
     currently removed 9.  So you need 3 more Aces to reach the goal.
   - This finds the best way to reach the goal or otherwise maximize the number
     of goal cards to remove.  There may be two solutions: one where you clear
     the board, and one where you don't clear the board but remove more goal
     cards than the board-clearing solution.

Pyramid Solitaire Example Deck:
When passing in a filename, create a text file that looks like this:
            Kd
          Kc  Qh
        Ah  7d  6d
      8d  5d  9d  4d
    Td  3d  Jd  2d  Qd
  Ad  7c  6c  8c  5c  9c
4c  Tc  3c  Jc  2c  Qc  Ac
6h 7h 5h 8h 4h 9h 3h Th 2h Jh Kh As 2s 3s 4s 5s 6s 7s 8s 9s Ts Js Qs Ks

6h is the top of the stock pile, and Ks is the bottom.

For TriPeaks Solitaire:
1. TriPeaks
   - Solve board challenges, clearing all cards from the board.
2. TriPeaks Board
   - The same as just TriPeaks (solving board challenges).
3. TriPeaks Score
   - Find the way to get the maximum possible score.
4. TriPeaks Score <Goal Score> <Current Score>
   - "TriPeaks Score 90000 38000" means you currently have 38000 points and the
     goal is to get 90000 points.
   - Find the way to reach the goal score given the current score, or if
     impossible, find the way to get the maximum possible score.
5. TriPeaks Card <Goal number of cards> <Card Rank> <number currently cleared>
   - "TriPeaks Card 11 A 2" means the goal is to remove 11 Aces, and you have
     currently removed 2.  So you need 9 more Aces to reach the goal.
   - This finds the best way to reach the goal or otherwise maximize the number
     of goal cards to remove.  There may be two solutions: one where you clear
     the board, and one where you don't clear the board but remove more goal
     cards than the board-clearing solution.

TriPeaks Solitaire Example Deck:
When passing in a filename, create a text file that looks like this:
      Kd          Kc          Qh
    Ah  7d      6d  8d      5d  9d
  4d  Td  3d  Jd  2d  Qd  Ad  7c  6c
8c  5c  9c  4c  Tc  3c  Jc  2c  Qc  Ac
6h 7h 5h 8h 4h 9h 3h Th 2h Jh Kh As 2s 3s 4s 5s 6s 7s 8s 9s Ts Js Qs Ks

6h is the top of the waste pile, 7h is the top of the stock pile, and Ks is the
bottom of the stock pile.

For FreeCell Solitaire:
FreeCell is totally different right now. It can scan the cards and show you the
cards in text format that you can copy and paste into Shlomi Fish's online
solver at https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/js-fc-solve/text/
1. FreeCell
   - Scan the cards and print the deck in for Shlomi Fish's solver to receive.
2. FreeCell Board
   - The same as just FreeCell (solving board challenges).
